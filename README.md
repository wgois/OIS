# OIS: Object oriented Input System

Cross Platform Object Oriented Input Lib System. Meant to be very robust and
compatiable with many systems and operating systems.

This is the official repository and is a continuation of the great work done by pjcast on the old sourceforge repo.

## Todo

- Merge pull requests/patches send in over time
- Cleanup and remove dead-code
- Start implementing support for new platforms and backends

## Compiling:
Win32/
	Contains Visual Studio .Net Solution Files

	make && make install

	---- Configure build options --------------------------------------------
	./configure --help              --- List all configure options


LinuxCB/
        Contains CodeBlock files for building OIS and Demos with codeblocks
        This project file looks for Ogre and other dependencies in /usr/local/lib
        and /usr/local/include. If installed elsewhere, modify the project
